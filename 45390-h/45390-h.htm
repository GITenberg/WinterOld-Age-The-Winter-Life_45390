      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he birds, quite
      mute, the trees, stripped of their green livery, the shortened days and
      lengthened nights, together with the piercing winds and pinching frosts,
      now show us that winter is come: stern Winter, which resembles Old Age, or
      the closing scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0002" id="linkimage-0002"> </a>

    </div>
    <p>
      Yet, even this season is not void of its beauties and blessings. The new
      fallen snow caps the mountains, and covers the valleys, with a white and
      beautiful vesture, which is thrown into many curious forms, folds, and
      ridges, by the rude blasts of the driving winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      What can exceed the dazzling splendour of a rising sun, on the trees and
      bushes, after a night of rain and freezing, when every branch appears like
      a shining crystal? A prospect grand indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      The severe frosts of Winter, with the agitated atmosphere, dispel the
      sickening fumes which arise from heated and stagnant pools, and decaying
      vegetation.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      This gives health and vigour to the body, and an it were, new spring to
      thought. Who but has observed the lively sensations of body and mind on a
      clear frosty morning in winter? What a contrast to the languor experienced
      after a sultry night in summer or in autumn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although there are now no fields of corn to hoe or harvest to cut, yet the
      winter is not a scene of inactivity. It is undoubtedly the will of Heaven,
      that man should labour&mdash;The constitutions of his body and mind are so
      formed, as greatly to need it. Moderate labour tends to the health of
      both.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woodman, with his axe, engages the sturdy oak, which by his repeated
      strokes, bows its ancient and venerable head, and comes tumbling to the
      ground. It is then cut into suitable lengths, and carted home for the
      fire.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      The grain is now threshed out from the straw, and cleared from the chaff
      by the wind or a fan. The wheat, rye, and buckwheat, are then carried to
      the mill, ground into flour, brought home and made into bread, pies,
      cakes, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barley is used to make beer, oats to feed horses, and Indian corn for both
      man and beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much attention to the poor dumb animals is necessary, who look up to man
      for protection. The horsed cows, and sheep are to be foddered early and
      late, and provided with proper shelter.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      The hogs are to be fed and furnished with a bed of straw. The turkeys,
      geese, and ducks, with the other poultry, will flock round the little boy
      or girl, who comes with a basket of corn to feed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flax in the winter is broken with a crackle, and then dressed on a
      swingling-board by a long wooden knife: afterwards passed through a
      hatchel, and then, by the industrious country woman and her daughters,
      spun into yarn, for the purpose of making linen for our shirts, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the long winter evenings, how pleasant for a family to sit by a good
      fire, and hear the cold wind whistling without; when; neighbour enjoys the
      company of neighbour, and treats him with a drink of palatable cider, and
      some good apples; while the little children are agreeably employed in
      cracking and eating the nuts which they gathered in the fall.

    <p>
      Some amuse themselves with riding in the sleigh, while the little boys
      glide swiftly, in many a curious curve, upon the ice; and, when the
      weather is foul, the little folks can suitably exercise themselves within
      doors at shuttlecock.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
